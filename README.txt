It takes around more than one hour to commute from my home to school. While returning home, I was thinking that 'I wish I could reach home in 
much lesser time and devote the same in playing activities'. I asked my father about this and he told me that this road congestion is due to 
heavy traffic caused by excessive use of private transport and can't be curbed till an effective public transport planning should be enforced.


After some days, my mother arranged a weekend get-together in CP for me and my friends. We were five and took four cars to reach that place. Then I 
thought that four of them are living in my neighbourhood. If all four of us would be using one car, then there will be a saving of fuel and
it will lead to less traffic congestion. 

I thought that if people living  nearby are travelling to destinations which are also near to each other in a common frame of time, then a car 
pooling organized system can be developed in which people can know that they have a chance to pool cars with others leading to savings and 
decongestion of traffic. This thought of mine, I'm trying to convert into an app which makes car pooling an effective method to save fuel and help
the society to live in a lesser polluted surroundings as well as ensuring smooth and free flow of traffic. So I decided to make an app an name it 
as 'Hum Rahi App'. 

So first when we start the app, some quesions will appearon the screen like where do we want to go, to where do we want to go,
the time and the assembly point. Then two buttons will come which are Vehicle- Self driven and Vehicle-other. 


If you choose the first option, it means you want to provide your vehicle to others. If you click on it, some more questions will come like number 
of passengers required, car name, your contact number and car plate number. After filling the form, you can press on the ok button and your 
registration would be done. 

If you click on the second option which is Vehicle-other, it means that you want to travel in other's car. So it would display the registered cars. 
But the app is not database enabled right now so that is not possible. 

So this was the 'Hum Rahi App'! I hoped you liked it. 
Thank you.
